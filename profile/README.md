## Welcome to Silversat!

SilverSat is a multi-year community-based non-profit serving tweens and teens in and around Silver Spring, Maryland. Our goal is to provide STEM enrichment ‚Äúto discover and expand knowledge‚Äù* and developing leadership among tweens and teens, including those from underrepresented and underserved groups in STEM fields.

Through this project, members are exploring** all aspects of satellites, CubeSat technology, communication systems, coding, project development, and circuits. Tweens and teens self select which aspect of the project they want to focus on. Through this process, those involved have gotten more specialized education and hands-on experience in areas such as building, soldering, and electronics. Members are also being given leadership opportunities on a regular basis.

Area tweens and teens represent a diverse student population. Members are in grades 7-11 and are a mix of public, private, and homeschooled students from the greater Silver Spring area and Washington, D.C.  Our diversity provides varying perspectives as well as many different areas of expertise that contributes to our progress and allows us to be more efficient in creating our CubeSat.

Our current work is contained in these repositories and represents the combined efforts of our students and mentors.  We're all still learning, so we hope you can learn along with us!
